# LED Blink – Arduino

## 📌 Project Overview
This is the most basic Arduino project where an LED turns ON and OFF at regular intervals.
It is commonly used as the first test program to verify Arduino setup and connectivity.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to control digital output pins
- Understand `setup()` and `loop()` functions
- Verify Arduino IDE and board setup

---

## 🧰 Components Required
- Arduino Uno / Nano / Mega
- LED (optional – built-in LED can be used)
- 220Ω or 330Ω resistor (for external LED)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

---

## 🔌 Circuit Diagram
Refer to `circuit.png` for wiring details.

If using **built-in LED**, no external wiring is required.

---

## 📜 How It Works
1. Arduino sets the LED pin as OUTPUT
2. LED turns ON for 1 second
3. LED turns OFF for 1 second
4. Process repeats continuously

---

## ▶️ Steps to Run
1. Connect Arduino to PC
2. Open `led-blink.ino` in Arduino IDE
3. Select correct **Board** and **Port**
4. Click **Upload**

---

## ✅ Expected Output
- LED blinks every 1 second

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Digital pin control
- Timing using `delay()`
- Basic Arduino program structure

---

## 🔁 Try Modifying
- Change delay value
- Use a different digital pin
- Blink multiple LEDs

---

Happy Coding 🚀
